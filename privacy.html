					<h2>4. Data collection on our website</h2>
					<h3>Server log files</h3>
					<p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in “server log files”. These are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
						<li>Operating system used</li>
						<li>Referrer URL</li>
						<li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
						<li>Time of the server request</li>
						<li>IP address</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Contact form/Emails</h3>
					<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form or email, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.</p>
					<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter into the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed prior to your request may still be legally processed.</p>
					<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>

					<h2>5. Analytics and advertising</h2>
					<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
					<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
					<p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. Cookies are text files that are stored on your computer to allow the analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
					<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
					<h4>IP anonymization</h4>
					<p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
					<h4>Browser plugin</h4>
					<p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" rel=”nofollow”>Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
					<h4>Objecting to the collection of data</h4>
					<p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: <a href="javascript:gaOptout();">Disable Google Analytics</a></p>
					<p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" rel=”nofollow”>Google’s privacy policy</a>.<p>
					<h4>Outsourced data processing</h4>
					<p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
